# Java Blackjack Project
This project, developed during the [Java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-java-development-bootcamp/) by Professor Rayan Slim at Learn The Part Inc., is a console-based implementation of the classic game Hangman. Players attempt to guess a word by suggesting letters, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed.

### Project Description
The Hangman project provides an interactive and entertaining game where players can test their word-guessing skills. The program randomly selects a word from a predefined list, and players attempt to guess the word one letter at a time.

### Key Features
- Random Word Selection: The game selects a random word from a predefined list, adding variety to each gameplay.

- Interactive Gameplay: Players make letter guesses, and the program provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses.

- Visual Representation: The game includes a visual representation of the hangman's gallows, updating with each incorrect guess.

- Win/Loss Conditions: The game ends when the player successfully guesses the word or exceeds the maximum allowed incorrect guesses.
